## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to explain how people can report a vulnerability in your project.

- **Where to report**: To report a vulnerability, please go to [Advisories](https://github.com/jd-apprentice/easy-static/security/advisories).

- **Acceptance Criteria**: The evaluation of a vulnerability report will be based on severity as determined by a security scanning tool, such as Trivy. We will accept vulnerability reports that qualify as "high" or higher according to Trivy's assessment.

- **Report Outcome**: If the vulnerability report is accepted, we will work on a solution and provide an estimated release date for the security update. If the report is declined, we will inform you of our reasons, and you may provide additional information if desired.
